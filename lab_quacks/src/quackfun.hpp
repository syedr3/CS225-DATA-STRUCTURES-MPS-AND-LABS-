 * brackets must be matched up correctly, with no extra, hanging, or unmatched
 * brackets. For example, the string "[hello][]" is balanced, "[[][[]a]]" is
 * balanced, "[]]" is unbalanced, "][" is unbalanced, and "))))[cs225]" is
 * balanced.

 * For this function, you may only create a single local variable of type
 * `stack<char>`! No other stack or queue local objects may be declared. Note
 * that you may still declare and use other local variables of primitive types.
